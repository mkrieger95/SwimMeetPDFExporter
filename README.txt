Hi there -

This is a work-in-progress on a project I have been wanting to do for some time.

For those who are familiar in swimming, for years results have been printed out or exported into a .PDF. Depending on your software you can also export specific files that can be read by Team Management software to either print out or export the results.

The issue that has come up is that there are many great meet results out there, but the only file that is still available to access is the printout/.PDF file. These are for sites that don't specialize in meet results keeping (SwimCloud, etc.) Clubs/Schools/Teams may not have submitted the specific export files that many sites such as SwimCloud.com can currently read. Or, you have sites that have upgraded/migrated to newer versions since 2000 or prior and the software-specific files were lost as part of the migration.

In short, this project is aiming to read meet result exports (primarily from Hy-Tek for time being) that have been exported to .PDF format and then export the data cleanly to a .CSV file.

The hope is to have a consistent export of these results to where this can be utilized by sites like SwimCloud, to archive these meets that only have a .PDF file available.

The end goal here is to be able to take these old .PDFs which may be the only remaining record of meet results for various meets, and throw them into a site/system which can continue to preserve these times in a more user-friendly method. There have been a few meets that I personally have wanted to "restore" from a .PDF so I can have it properly archived for years to come.
